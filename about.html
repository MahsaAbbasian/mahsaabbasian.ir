				<h2>Mahsa Abbasian</h2>
				<h6>Software Developer</h6>
				<h6>4 years in the business</h6>
				<p>I am a patient and creative developer who wants to develop services with the user in focus. My ambition is to bring together functionality and design by delivering products that look as good as they perform. I am a social person who is eager to learn new technology and techniques from new projects. It is interesting and fun to work with people with different cultures, roles, and experience levels. </p>
				<p>Besides professional work, it's fun to learn more about web development and expand my knowledge in this area. In order to enjoy my study in this area, I created my own webpage and I apply my learnings to this page accordingly.</p>
				<p>I study software engineering and management at Gothenburg university which provided theoretical knowledge and practical skills in the IT industry. I developed my skills in computer applications, asking the right questions to the customer, translating customer answers into design and managing projects, organizations, and analyze a problem. During this time I had a chance of supervising students for Self-Driving Miniature Cars at IT University of Gothenburg for one semester.</p>
				<p>I have been working in an XFT-team with a focus on agile development using SCRUM, I mainly working as a developer for AMF (Access and Mobility Management Function) within Ericsson´s Packet Core products. The team developed internal node communication improved by adding support for TLS (Transport Layer Security) and DNS (Domain Name System) lookups.</p>
				<p>Development of features for Ericsson’s Packet core products within IoT (Internet Of Things) in MME( Mobility Management Entity) area. Erlang was used as a Functional language to develop new features for Ericsson’s 4G packet core products. The team worked according to the agile method Scrum, and continuous integration was a large part of the way of working used. I was taking a part in sprint planning according to this methodology.</p>
				<p>Teacher Assistant for Self-Driving Miniature Cars to a Standardized Experimental Platform at IT University of Gothenburg. The requirement for the course was based on C/C++ knowledge and some basic knowledge on hardware such as Arduino. The mini car was using image processing ,infrared and ultrasonic sensors in line detection , overtaking and parking scenarios. My responsibility was guiding student on parking and overtaking section based on my experience an knowledge from Design and Development of Embedded Systems course and project a year ahead.</p>
